# HTML and CSS
In my HTML and CSS repository, you will find projects titled with specific techniques I utilized for that particular application.
Here is a project that incorporated Bootstrap techniques:
* [Cinema Home Page](https://github.com/therubini/HTML-and-CSS/tree/master/bootstrap4)

The majority of my HTML and CSS were extensively incorporated in my other repositories.
* [JavaScript](https://github.com/therubini/JS-Projects)
